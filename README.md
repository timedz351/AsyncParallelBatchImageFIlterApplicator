# AsyncParallelBatchImageFIlterApplicator

Final 4th semester project for course: Introduction to C#/.NET.

## Assignment
Use gained knowledge from semester and create a project using: asynchronous functions, parallel functions, WinForms, read/write to/from file

## Result
I created a application with simple UI which can asynchronously and parallely in batches (depending on number of photos) apply one of provided filters. 

- save & load is asynchronous and parallel 
- filters are applied asynchronously and parallely
- filter is applied to each photo parallely, photo is divided to 4 smaller photos - batch
- each filter effect can be previewed in the UI before applying
- it's actually really fast ðŸ˜®
